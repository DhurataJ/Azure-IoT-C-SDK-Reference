# IoTHubClient_SetDeviceTwinCallback()

This API specifies a call back to be used when the device receives a state update.

## Syntax

\#include "[azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client.h](../iothub-client-h.md)"  
```C
IOTHUB_CLIENT_RESULT IoTHubClient_SetDeviceTwinCallback(
  IOTHUB_CLIENT_HANDLE                iotHubClientHandle,
  IOTHUB_CLIENT_DEVICE_TWIN_CALLBACK  deviceTwinCallback,
  void *                              userContextCallback
);
```

## Parameters
* `iotHubClientHandle` The handle created by a call to the create function. 

* `deviceTwinCallback` The callback specified by the device client to be used for updating the desired state. The callback will be called in response to a request send by the IoTHub services. The payload will be passed to the callback, along with two version numbers:

* LastSeenReported: 

* `userContextCallback` User specified context that will be provided to the callback. This can be NULL.

**NOTE:** The application behavior is undefined if the user calls the [IoTHubClient_Destroy](../iothub-client-h/iothubclient-destroy.md) function from within any callback.

## Return Value
IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK upon success or an error code upon failure.
