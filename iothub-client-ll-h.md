# iothub_client_ll.h 

APIs that allow a user (usually a device) to communicate with an Azure IoTHub.

## Detailed Description

IoTHubClient_LL is a module that allows a user (usually a device) to communicate with an Azure IoTHub. It can send events and receive messages. At any given moment in time there can only be at most 1 message callback function.

This API surface contains a set of APIs that allows the user to interact with the lower layer portion of the IoTHubClient. These APIs contain _LL_ in their name, but retain the same functionality like the IoTHubClient_... APIs, with one difference. If the _LL_ APIs are used then the user is responsible for scheduling when the actual work done by the IoTHubClient happens (when the data is sent/received on/from the wire). This is useful for constrained devices where spinning a separate thread is often not desired.

## Functions

Function Name                  | Description                                
--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
[IoTHubClient_LL_CreateFromConnectionString](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-createfromconnectionstring.md)            | Creates a IoT Hub client for communication with an existing IoT Hub using the specified connection string parameter.
[IoTHubClient_LL_Create](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-create.md)            | Creates a IoT Hub client for communication with an existing IoT Hub using the specified parameters.
[IoTHubClient_LL_CreateWithTransport](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-createwithtransport.md)            | Creates a IoT Hub client for communication with an existing IoT Hub using an existing transport.
[IoTHubClient_LL_CreateFromDeviceAuth](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-createfromdeviceauth.md)            | Creates a IoT Hub client for communication with an existing IoT Hub using the device auth module.
[IoTHubClient_LL_Destroy](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-destroy.md)            | Disposes of resources allocated by the IoT Hub client. This is a blocking call.
[IoTHubClient_LL_SendEventAsync](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-sendeventasync.md)            | Asynchronous call to send the message specified by eventMessageHandle.
[IoTHubClient_LL_GetSendStatus](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-getsendstatus.md)            | This function returns the current sending status for IoTHubClient.
[IoTHubClient_LL_SetMessageCallback](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-setmessagecallback.md)            | Sets up the message callback to be invoked when IoT Hub issues a message to the device. This is a blocking call.
[IoTHubClient_LL_SetConnectionStatusCallback](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-setconnectionstatuscallback.md)            | Sets up the connection status callback to be invoked representing the status of the connection to IOT Hub. This is a blocking call.
[IoTHubClient_LL_SetRetryPolicy](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-setretrypolicy.md)            | Sets up the connection status callback to be invoked representing the status of the connection to IOT Hub. This is a blocking call.
[IoTHubClient_LL_GetRetryPolicy](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-getretrypolicy.md)            | Sets up the connection status callback to be invoked representing the status of the connection to IOT Hub. This is a blocking call.
[IoTHubClient_LL_GetLastMessageReceiveTime](./iothub-client-ll-h/iothubclient-ll-getlastmessagereceivetime.md)            | This function returns in the out parameter lastMessageReceiveTime what was the value of the time function when the last message was received at the client.
